You are given a dataset of actors and the films they have been involved in, including each film's release date and rating. For each actor, calculate the difference between the rating of their most recent film and their average rating across all previous films (the average rating excludes the most recent one).

Return a list of actors along with their average lifetime rating, the rating of their most recent film, and the difference between the two ratings. Round the difference calculation to 2 decimal places. If an actor has only one film, return 0 for the difference and their only filmâ€™s rating for both the average and latest rating fields.
